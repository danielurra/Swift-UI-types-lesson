## Type-safe
Swift is a `type-safe` language, It checks to see whether you’re assigning values of the correct type<br>
to variables and flags mismatched types as errors.<br>

## Type inference
Swift automatically determines the constant or variable `type` based on the **value provided**.<br>
This is called type inference.<br>
You can see the type of a constant or variable by holding down the `Option key` and clicking its name.<br>

## Type annotation
Type a colon (:) after a constant or variable name, followed by the desired type.<br>
This is known as type annotation.<br>
