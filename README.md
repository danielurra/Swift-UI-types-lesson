# Swift UI types lesson
## Similar types as in other languages
* String
* Int (integer, a whole)
* Float (32 bits)
* Double (64 bits)
* Bool (boolean, true or false)
* Color (special type for colors)
* etc.
  
## Type-safe
Swift is a `type-safe` language, It checks to see whether you’re assigning values of the correct type<br>
to variables and flags mismatched types as errors.<br>

## Type inference
Swift automatically determines the constant or variable `type` based on the **value provided**.<br>
This is called type inference.<br>

You can see the type of a constant or variable by holding down the `Option key` and clicking its name.<br>

## Operators can only work with operands of the same type.

## Type annotation
Type a colon (:) after a constant or variable name, followed by the desired type.<br>
This is known as type annotation.<br>

## Constants and variables
You can use `constants` or `variables` to **store** values. Both are containers that have a name, <br>
but a con- stant’s value can only be set once and cannot be changed after they are set, <br>
whereas a variable’s value can be changed at any time.<br>
You must declare constants and variables before you use them.<br>
Constants are declared with the `let` keyword while variables are declared with the `var` keyword.<br>
